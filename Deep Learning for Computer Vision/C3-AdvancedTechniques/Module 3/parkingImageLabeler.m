% Write an automation function for the parking images
% using the detector from parkingYoloXDetectorSolution.mat
%
% Remember to:
% - Align the function name with the file name
% - Use a persistent variable for the detector for greater efficiency
%
% For each input image, save the output as a structure with 
%    the following fields for each label type:
% - "Name" containing the label name
% - "Type" containing the label type/shape
% - "Position" containing all bounding boxes with that label
% 
% If you get stuck, refer to FastenersImageLabeler.m for an example

function autoLabels = parkingImageLabeler(I)
% Add your code here
