**Course Project â€” MathWorks & Coursera**

---

### ðŸš€ Project Overview  
This repository contains MATLAB code examples and scripts developed while completing the [Introduction to Deep Learning for Computer Vision](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-learning-computer-vision-matlab) course by MathWorks on Coursera.  

Learned concepts include:  
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)  
- Transfer Learning with pretrained models (AlexNet, ResNet-18)  
- Image Classification  
- Data preparation and augmentation  
- Model training and evaluation
